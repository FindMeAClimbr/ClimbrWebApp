# ClimbrWebApp

This is the web front-end of the Find Me a Climbr service.

The site uses React, bootstrapped with the Create React
App tool. Read more about it [here](docs/REACT.md).

## Development

To develop, you'll need [node](http://nodejs.org), and
[yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) to get started. Once those
are installed, just run the following in this directory:

```
    $ yarn
```

The is only necessary the first time you run it and this
will install all necessary packages the project is
dependent on.

```
    $ yarn start
```

This will start the development server and open the site
in your web browser.  You can also build the site for
deployment by running `yarn build`.

Happy hacking!
